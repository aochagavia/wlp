\section{Introduction}

Even after decades of software verification research, there are still serious
limitations to automated formal verification methods \cite{d2008survey}. A
possible alternative to these methods is automated testing, which usually
offers better scalability by trading off correctness.

Within the field of automated software testing, different approaches have been
tried. A relatively recent overview of the current state of affairs is
presented by Ammann \cite{ammann2008introduction}. In this project, we face
the problem of automated generation and running of test cases based on the
model of programs. Said models not only reflect the behavior of a given
program, but also provide assumptions and assertions that should be respected.

% Other examples of automated testing: fuzzers (American Fuzzy Lop) \cite{takanen2008fuzzing}, or even QuickCheck to some extent

\section{The Verificaction Tool}

The verification tool implemented in this project models programs using a
variant of Dijkstra's Guarded Command Language (GCL) \cite{Dijkstra:gcl}.
The language supports assertions, which are treated as postconditions,
and assumptions, treated as preconditions.

By using the Weakest Liberal Precondition predicate transformer (WLP), our
tool initially generates a first order logic expression. Afterwards, the tool
tries to ensure that said expression is always true, which means that the
postconditions in the model follow from the stated preconditions. Below we
discuss both.

\subsection{WLP difficulties and edge cases}

TODO: Explain why it is not that trivial...

\subsection{Generating test cases based on the WLP}

Random test generation and running is achieved by using QuickCheck \cite{claessen2011quickcheck}
with custom generators.

\section{Results}

At least discuss the examples that you are requested
to solve, and how you solve them.
